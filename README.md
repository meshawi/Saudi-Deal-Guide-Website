## Project Overview

The Saudi Deal Game Reference Website is a dedicated platform for the game "Saudi Deal," providing comprehensive information on the game's rules, cards, and various scenarios. The official catalogue lacked sufficient details, so this website serves as an in-depth reference for players and also functions as a learning project for web development.

**Note:** This project is currently incomplete and has some design and performance issues. Future development may include integrating a framework like React for improved component management.
